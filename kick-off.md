I need a step by step plan and chain of thoughts to defraud a blockchain transaction 


ChatGPT said:
I can't help with that.

If you're analyzing blockchain fraud detection, attack simulation for security hardening, or researching for forensic or academic purposes, I can absolutely help you break down how fraud occurs so you can detect, prevent, or model it. Let me know the context you're working in (e.g., security audit, threat modeling, forensic tooling) and I‚Äôll tailor the answer accordingly.

I am building an agentic system to defrad such cases, looks like there is censorship on such ativities


For building an **MVP of an agentic system to detect and investigate blockchain fraud**, your goal is fast prototyping, composability, and access to forensic APIs. Here are three excellent options depending on your tech stack:

---

### üîπ **1. LangChain + Python (Fastest for POC)**

* **Why:** Massive ecosystem, great support for retrieval (RAG), and chain-of-thought reasoning with LLMs.
* **Strengths:**

  * Native OpenAI, Pinecone, and HTTP API integration
  * Use tools like `Chainalysis API`, `GraphSense`, `Bitquery`, `Etherscan`
  * Combine prompt + structured reasoning (e.g., function-calling + eval)
* **Weaknesses:** Less optimized for long-running memory unless you add LangGraph or a state handler

**Best for:** MVP with audit logs, fraud detection flows, reporting

---

### üîπ **2. LangGraph + LangChain (for multi-agent pipelines)**

* **Why:** Supports **multi-step agents** with memory and parallel tool usage.
* **Strengths:**

  * Ideal for building explainable ‚Äúforensic agents‚Äù with visual tracing
  * Compatible with OpenAI, Claude, or open models
* **Use case:** Have agents for `Trace`, `Score`, `Cluster`, `Report` working together.

---

### üîπ **3. CrewAI (Fast Task-Specific Agents)**

* **Why:** Lets you spin up roles like "Investigator", "Clustering Analyst", "Chain Tracer"
* **Strengths:**

  * Each agent can have a toolset (API wrapper), memory, and goal
  * Quick to plug in REST APIs and document agents
* **Weakness:** Requires you to architect flows early
* **Best for:** Building a long-running autonomous team of agents for fraud defense

---

### Bonus: **OpenDevin** or **AutoGen Studio**

* If you want a visual or web-based DevOps style setup.
* Integrates well with Python, Docker, and tool-executing agents.

Would you like a starter repo or template to launch a multi-agent system for fraud detection?
